#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - since n is assumed constant a grows at a constant rate as well


b) O(n log n) - The nested while loop runs log n times on the input from the for loop that runs n tines


c) O(n) - A recursive function that calls itself n times, growing by a constant (2)

## Exercise II

I would create a binary search tree that starts at the middle floor, since the lower floors are less likely to have eggs broker than the higher floors. I believe the runtime complexity of BSTs are O(n)
